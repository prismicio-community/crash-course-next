# Prismic + Next.js Crash Course

[Prismic][prismic] is a headless website builder. With a traditional CMS, you can manage a website's text and images. With Prismic, you can also manage website components â€” so teams can build their entire website with Prismic.

This repository should be used alongside [Prismic's Crash Course guide][prismic-crash-course].

## ðŸš€ Quick start

The fastest way to learn Prismic is with a hands-on demo.

```sh
npx prismic-cli@latest theme \
  --theme-url https://github.com/prismicio-community/crash-course-next \
  --conf sm.json
```

With this command, youâ€™ll get a fully-featured Prismic website to test out.

Youâ€™ll be asked to log in with a Prismic account and name a new Prismic content repository. Go ahead and name the repository anything you want.

Once the app is created, navigate into the app directory and start it up.

```sh
npm run dev
```

Youâ€™ll be able to see the live site running at <http://localhost:3000>.
